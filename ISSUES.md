# Ray — Known Issues & Feature Gaps

Last updated: 2026-04-11. Generated from full codebase audit + E2E gap review.

---

## P0 — Broken / Blocks Use

### 1. LLM tool calls return "internal error" in UI
**Symptom**: Sending a message that triggers a tool call (e.g. "what time is it?", "calculate 2+2") shows an inline error bubble instead of a result.  
**Root cause (confirmed)**: `web_search_preview` was injected into every Responses API request unconditionally. `gpt-5-nano` (the default model) does not support this tool — the API returns a 400 which surfaces as an internal error.  
**Status**: Fixed in `cc5e145`. `_supports_web_search_preview(model)` now gates injection.  
**Test gap**: Covered in full-coverage.spec.ts §7 "LLM tool calls (live)".

### 2. Chat may show duplicate messages after reload
**Symptom**: After the bootstrap greeting, the trigger message `[starting up for the first time]` was persisted to the DB but not shown in UI state. Selecting the conversation loaded both, making the greeting appear to repeat.  
**Root cause (confirmed)**: `streamResponse` saved all `msgHistory` messages to the DB unconditionally, including the internal bootstrap trigger.  
**Status**: Fixed in `305ccd3`. Bootstrap call now passes `saveMessages=false`.  
**Test**: Covered in full-coverage.spec.ts "bootstrap doesn't persist trigger message".

### 3. `/bootstrap done` gateway timeout on slow LLMs
**Symptom**: First `/bootstrap done` call returns a Traefik 504. Reloading then shows the greeting correctly.  
**Root cause (confirmed)**: `_finalize_bootstrap` buffered the entire LLM response before yielding any SSE — Traefik killed the idle connection.  
**Status**: Fixed in `0d95b1a`. Keepalive pings every 4 s via `asyncio.wait`.  
**Test gap**: No test verifies keepalive flow under a simulated slow LLM.

## P1 — Core Feature Gaps

### 4. Memory recall not wired into chat context
**Status**: Fixed. `memory_search(last_user_msg, limit=4)` runs before each turn in `chat.py`. Results are injected via `build_agent_context(injected_memories=...)` and appear as a `## Relevant Memory` section in the system prompt.

### 5. Memory panel absent
**Status**: Fixed. `ui/src/components/MemoryPanel.tsx` — sidebar panel with search input, paginated result list, and per-entry delete. Accessible via the "Memory" nav button. Backed by GET `/api/memory`, POST `/api/memory/search`, DELETE `/api/memory/{id}`.

### 6. Web search citations not rendered for function tool results
**Status**: Fixed. `web_search` already returned `{results: [{url, title, snippet}]}`. Added `ray_citations` SSE emission in `_do_stream()` after each `web_search` tool call — same format as `web_search_preview` so citation cards render for gpt-5-nano too.

### 7. PDF / file upload has no RAG ingestion pipeline
**Symptom**: The upload button accepts files. The `/api/documents` endpoint and chunking utilities exist. But uploaded files are never chunked, embedded, or stored in ChromaDB — so they can never be recalled.  
**Status**: `test_rag.py` tests chunking in isolation. `FileUpload` POSTs to `/api/documents` but the backend processor is a stub.  
**Fix needed**: `api/routers/documents.py` — accept upload → chunk → embed via ChromaDB → store. Inject relevant chunks into system prompt on each turn.

### 8. Model switching has no UI
**Status**: Fixed. `Header.tsx` now shows a `<select>` dropdown when multiple models are configured (hidden for single-model setups). Selection updates `selectedModel` state in `App.tsx` which is passed in every `POST /api/chat` call. Backed by existing `GET /api/models` and `resolve_model_provider`.

## P2 — Missing UI for Working Backend Features

### 9. Workspace file editors absent
**Status**: Fixed. `WorkspacePanel.tsx` — three-tab panel (Soul / User / Identity) with load, edit, and save. Accessible via the "Workspace" nav button. Backed by existing `GET/PUT /api/identity/{soul,me,identity}` endpoints.

### 10. API key management absent
**Status**: Fixed. `POST /api/auth/key` (generate/rotate) and `DELETE /api/auth/key` (revoke) added to `api/main.py`. `ApiKeyPanel` component added to sidebar — generate, rotate, revoke, and copy-to-clipboard in one place. Returns 409 when key already exists without `?force=true`.

### 11. MCP server registration requires manual JSON
`workspace/mcp_servers.json` must be edited by hand. The MCP panel shows server status but has no form to add/remove servers.

### 12. Settings panel missing entirely
No UI for editing rate limits, exec allow-list, model defaults, or any other configuration. Everything requires file edits or raw API calls.

### 13. `/agent` slash command not registered
**Status**: Fixed. `/agent [name]` registered in `api/commands/builtin.py`. `/agent list` shows available agents; `/agent <name>` redirects the current message through the named agent. Unknown names return an error. `chat.py` extracts `explicit_agent` from redirect results and passes it to `route_message()`.

### 14. Skill builder has no UI
**Status**: Fixed. `api/routers/skills.py` adds `GET/POST/DELETE /api/skills` endpoints. Workspace skills written to `workspace/skills.yaml` and merged over built-ins at load time. `SkillsPanel` component added to sidebar — view built-in and custom skills, create new skills via form, delete custom ones.

## P3 — Test Gaps

### 15. No E2E test for LLM-driven tool call flow
**Status**: Covered in full-coverage.spec.ts §7 (live, skips without API key).

### 16. No E2E test for memory store → recall
**Status**: Covered in full-coverage.spec.ts §9 (API + `/tool` via chat).  
**Remaining gap**: No test for proactive recall — store a fact, start a new conversation, ask a related question, verify it appears in the LLM response without explicit `/tool` invocation. Blocked until #4 is implemented.

### 17. No E2E test for web search end-to-end
**Status**: Covered in full-coverage.spec.ts §8 (live).

### 18. No E2E test for image upload → multimodal response
**Status**: Partial — tests upload button presence and `POST /api/documents` acceptance.  
**Remaining gap**: No test uploads an actual image and verifies the LLM describes its contents. Requires `page.setInputFiles()` interaction + live LLM.

### 19. No E2E test for background task lifecycle
**Status**: Covered in full-coverage.spec.ts §10 including poll-until-complete (live).

### 20. No E2E test for scheduled task create → list → **disable**
**Status**: Create + list covered in full-coverage.spec.ts §11.  
**Remaining gap**: No test disables a schedule and verifies it no longer appears as enabled.

### 21. No E2E test for auth enforcement
**Status**: Covered in full-coverage.spec.ts §19 (skips if auth not enabled).

### 22. No E2E test for exec approval full UI path
**Status**: Disallowed command rejection covered. Blocked command + metacharacter tests covered.  
**Remaining gap**: No test sends `/exec git status` from the chat UI, waits for the approval card, clicks Approve, and verifies the command output appears.

### 23. No Docker-stack E2E config
**Status**: Fixed — `tests/playwright.docker.config.ts` + `npm run test:docker` added in `706c8ab`.

### 24. Bootstrap → reload → no duplicates regression
**Status**: Covered in full-coverage.spec.ts (live, skips if already bootstrapped).

### 25. No E2E test for image upload → multimodal LLM response *(new)*
No test uses `page.setInputFiles()` to attach a real image, sends it with a question, and verifies the assistant describes the image content. Blocked until the file input is directly accessible (currently behind a button click that opens OS picker).

### 26. No E2E test for schedule disable *(new)*
No test creates a schedule via `POST /api/schedules`, then PATCHes `enabled: false`, and verifies the schedule panel shows it as disabled and the scheduler no longer runs it.

### 27. No E2E test for exec Approve button in UI *(new)*
No test exercises the full approval card flow: send `/exec git status` → wait for approval card to render → click Approve → verify command output appears in chat. The card exists in `exec.spec.ts` parsing tests but the UI click path is untested.

## P4 — Code Quality / Architecture

### 28. Two model capability functions duplicating `gpt-5-nano` knowledge
**Status**: Fixed. `_MODEL_CAPS_BLACKLIST` dict in `api/llm/responses.py` centralises per-capability model restrictions. `_supports_temperature` and `_supports_web_search_preview` both check against it. Adding a new restricted model requires one dict entry.

### 29. `auto_title()` LLM call has no timeout
**Status**: Fixed. `_llm_title()` now wraps the `asyncio.to_thread` call with `asyncio.wait_for(timeout=10.0)`. Slow/unavailable API calls are cancelled after 10 seconds; the title falls back to "New Chat" silently.

### 30. `OllamaProvider.stream_chat` did not emit `[DONE]` on error path
If the Ollama HTTP call failed before the `for` loop, the SSE parser would hang waiting for `[DONE]`.  
**Status**: Fixed in `706c8ab`.

### 31. `asyncio.wait` called with a list, not a set
`asyncio.wait([task], ...)` constructs a new list per iteration; `asyncio.wait` requires a set.  
**Status**: Fixed in `706c8ab`.

### 32. Inner imports inside `event_generator()` in `_finalize_bootstrap`
`from agents.prompt_builder import load_workspace_file` and `from commands.builtin import _extract_user_name` were imported inside the nested function, re-running on every bootstrap call.  
**Status**: Fixed in `706c8ab`.

### 33. Pre/post command hook rules have no UI and no test coverage
The hook engine emits all events. Webhook CRUD is UI-visible and tested. But the `pre_command` / `post_command` rule type (which can cancel operations) is untested and has no management UI.
